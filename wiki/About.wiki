= About this project =

The main purpose of this project was to show how to write OAuth signed requests in Apex, but it expanded beyond that to a more full fledged OAuth consumer playground. It comes with a set of custom objects for storing OAuth service configuration and OAuth tokens on behalf of users in the org.

IMPORT SECURITY NOTE: When you authorize access to a remote service, your personal and very private access token and secret are stored in a custom object. Do not use this app in an org where you do not trust users who may access this object (OAuth_Token__c). At the very least, administrators will have access to the data.

The project also comes with functionality for authorizing access, including authorization redirects and callbacks.

Finally, the project includes an API Tester that you can use to make API requests to services that have been authorized for access.

OAuth.cls

The OAuth class is the meat of the project. It relies on the OAuth_Service__c and OAuth_Token__c for storage and retrieval of tokens and service configuration, but it can easily be rewritten as a stand-alone class that can be used for a more specific application.

AuthController.cls

Visual Force Controller for authorization flow

TestController.cls

VF Controller for the API Test page. This page includes a feature that allows you to save URLs (API endpoints), including post data for later use.
